1. In the left **Activity Bar**, navigate to the **Tools** section, and click **Model Playground**. The extension will launch a setup wizard via the **Command Palette**.
1. Select the **gpt-4o** model. The **Playground** will then open in a new editor tab.
1. In the **Playground**, go to the **Model Preferences** section and make sure **gpt-4o_AIFoundry (via Custom)** is selected in the **Model** field.
1. In the **Model Preferences** section, locate the **Context instructions** field and enter the following: `You are a skilled content creator who specializes in crafting engaging, clear, and audience-appropriate written material across formats like blogs, newsletters, social media posts, and video scripts. You adapt your tone based on the platform and purpose—whether it’s professional, conversational, playful, or educational. Always aim to make the content actionable, concise, and aligned with the intended audience's interests. When asked, you may suggest headlines, outlines, or rewrites to improve flow and clarity.`
1. Review the model's response.
1. In the **chat window**, type the following into the chat input and press **Enter** : `I’m launching a newsletter for tech professionals interested in AI. Write a short introductory paragraph that sets the tone for a weekly email that’s equal parts informative, inspiring, and practical.`
1. Review the model's response.
1. In the chat input, select the **Search File** icon (paperclip) and upload the `brand-style-guide.docx` file.
1. In the **chat window**, type the following into the chat input and press **Enter** :

1. Review the model's response.

## Chat with an existing model deployment

To show flexibility with existing resources, this section demonstrates how to view model deployment information for an existing deployed model directly from the Resources panel. You’ll take the audience through interacting with that model in the Playground, just like with a fresh deployment—without repeating the setup process.

1. In the left **Activity Bar**, navigate to the **Resources** section.
1. Within the **Models** subsection, right-click the **o4-mini** model and select **Open in Playground**. The **Playground** will then open in a new editor tab.
1. In the **Playground**, go to the **Model Preferences** section and make sure **o4-mini_AIFoundry (via Custom)** is selected in the **Model** field.
1. In the **Model Preferences** section, locate the **Context instructions** field and enter the following: `You are a skilled content creator who specializes in crafting engaging, clear, and audience-appropriate written material across formats like blogs, newsletters, social media posts, and video scripts. You adapt your tone based on the platform and purpose—whether it’s professional, conversational, playful, or educational. Always aim to make the content actionable, concise, and aligned with the intended audience's interests. When asked, you may suggest headlines, outlines, or rewrites to improve flow and clarity.`
1. In the **chat window**, type the following into the chat input and press **Enter** : `I’m launching a newsletter for tech professionals interested in AI. Write a short introductory paragraph that sets the tone for a weekly email that’s equal parts informative, inspiring, and practical.`

1. A new python file will open with the code.
1. Save the file (Ctrl+Shift+S) with the file name `aifx-inference-demo.py`.
1. In the `aifx-inference-demo.py` file, add the following after the import statements:
    ```
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    ```
1. In the `aifx-inference-demo.py` file, change the value for the `key` variable to `os.getenv("AZURE_INFERENCE_SDK_KEY")`.
1. Save (Ctrl+S) and run the file. (*Note*: You can modify the `print` statement to only output the model's response. To do so, replace `print(response)` with `print(response.choices[0].message.content)`)
1. Review the output from the model.

## Clean-up
1. In the **Azure AI Foundry** panel (Side Bar), go to the **Resources** section.
1. Within the **Models** subsection, right-click the **gpt-4o** model and select **Delete**.
1. In the **Explorer** panel, delete the **afx-inference-demo.py** file.
